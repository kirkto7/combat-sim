Large thuds echo from the footsteps of the machine, while the slapping noises of the frog are barely audible. Within ten feet of the machine, the frog draws two daggers from its side.

The machine whirls around, trying to grab him. Its steel fist finds the little grung on occasion, pounding into it. The frog reels in pain, but hardens its resolve as it refuses to release the robot. It isn't long before the grung digs its dagger into the perfect spot, deep within the neck of the machine.
